### Romanization
Romanization is the process of converting a languageâ€™s writing system into the Latin (Roman) alphabet. It is commonly used to represent languages that use non-Latin scripts, such as Chinese, Arabic, Burmese, or Japanese, in a form that can be read by speakers of languages that use the Latin alphabet.

There are different systems of Romanization depending on the language, and some systems aim to represent the pronunciation accurately, while others focus on preserving the original spelling. For example:

Pinyin is a Romanization system for Mandarin Chinese that helps people pronounce Chinese characters.
Hepburn is a Romanization system for Japanese that closely matches the way Japanese words sound.
Romanization is particularly helpful for learning languages, typing in languages that use non-Latin scripts, and facilitating international communication.
