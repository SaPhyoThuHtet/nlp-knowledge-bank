### Grapheme

A grapheme is like a letter or a small piece of a word that helps us write down sounds. For example, the letter "A" is a grapheme because it shows the sound "ah" or "ay" in different words. When we put graphemes together, we make words that we can read and say out loud, like using the letters "c," "a," and "t" to write the word "cat." Each letter in the word helps us know what sounds to make when we read.

### Phoneme

A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a language that can change the meaning of a word. Think of it like a sound that helps us tell words apart. For example, in English, the words "bat" and "pat" are different because of the sounds "b" and "p." These are phonemes.
So, while graphemes are letters or symbols we use to write, phonemes are the sounds we hear and say when we speak!
